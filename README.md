## 📊 Dataset Overview

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a more complex version of the classic MNIST dataset, containing:

- **Training Images**: 60,000 samples
- **Test Images**: 10,000 samples  
- **Image Dimensions**: 28×28 pixels (grayscale)
- **Categories**: 10 distinct clothing types

### 🏷️ Classification Labels

| Label | Category |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tedshub/fashion-classifier-mnsit.git
   cd fashion-classifier-mnsit
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the main classification script:

```bash
python model_fashion_mnsit.py
```

### Expected Output

The script will provide:
- Training progress for each epoch
- Model accuracy on test data
- Loss and accuracy visualization (if implemented)
